# Rust Mini Projects 🦀

This repository contains a collection of small projects and experiments created while learning the Rust programming language. Each project focuses on practicing specific concepts, patterns, or problem-solving approaches, serving as both a learning log and a playground for building Rust skills.

## Structure

- Each folder represents a standalone mini project.
- All code is written as Cargo projects for easy compilation, testing, and experimentation.

## Goals

- Strengthen understanding of Rust syntax and core concepts.
- Practice writing safe, efficient, and idiomatic Rust code.
- Explore practical applications of Rust through small, focused projects.
- Build a reference library of examples for future projects.
